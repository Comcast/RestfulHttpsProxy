# How to Contribute

Thank you for considering helping out!

First, please read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We take it very seriously!

Next, if you want to help out, do the following:

1. Fork the project.
2. Make a feature branch with the name of your change.
3. Make a change.
4. Commit your code.
5. Issue a Pull Request.

Once your PR is issued, we will review your work and decide on adding it to the project!

## New Features

Before starting work on a new feature, open an issue to describe it and why it is needed. This will provide early feedback about the feature from the community.
If you just want to work on a feature, put a comment under it stating you will work on it. If you no longer intend to work on it, edit the comment to reflect this.

The template for opening a feature request is only a suggestion. If the feature does not fill out the template completley, that is ok.

## Issues/Bugs

If you decide to fix a bug, put a comment under its cooresponding issue that mentions that you will attempt to fix it. 
If you no longer intend to work on it, edit the comment to reflect this.

The template for opening an issue is only a suggestion. If the issue does not fill out the template completley, that is ok. Provide as much console logs as possible.
